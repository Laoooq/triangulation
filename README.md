target triangulation method
employs a method of determining three spatial
coordinates of a target based on information from
two-dimensional direction finders which
independently measure the azimuth and position
angle of the object. Said method involves
determination of the approach point of bearings in
space. The determined point lies at minimum distance
from two bearings. The bearing of the target is given
by the stand point of the bearing source and the
direction to the target from the stand point. The
stand point is defined by coordinates (x, y, h) and
the direction to the target is given by the azimuth
and position angle. Parameters are given in the leftside rectangular coordinate system. The method
enables to determine additional data of the spatial
position of bearings in the vicinity of the approach
point.
EFFECT: distinction of real and false targets,
shorter time for location using active apparatus,
higher potential for passive target detection.
